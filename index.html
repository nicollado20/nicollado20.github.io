	<h3><center>MY LIFE'S JOURNEY(IMPLIED)</center></h3>
<p>I woke up with a quiet morning. This is what I always experience in this wonderful paradise which I call "my home". Nowhere else to compare, nowhere else to come back for. It has simple features but a lot of memories are kept here.If one wants to know a kind, he/she has to find its home to know its true qualities and characteristics.</p>
<p> The beautiful trees that surround this paradise give me the vibe that I want to experience for the rest of my life.Could this be the option that I can resort to? This is the zone that keeps me safe and sound.</p>
<p>The leaves were noiselessly dancing. The movements were unpredictable as no path had been identified with certainty for every strike that it received from the wind. From that point I asked myself, where could I be headed to? Where could this wind take me? These questions were associated with my life's journey, which is quite blurry as of the moment.</p>
<p>The things that I do today could either lead me to something that I want or it won't for better reasons.</p>
